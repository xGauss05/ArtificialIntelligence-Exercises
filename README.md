## Exercises

### Patrolling & Wander - [Video](https://github.com/xGauss05/ArtificialIntelligence-Exercises/blob/main/Assets/Project/Videos/Patrol%26Wander.mp4)
Create an scene with two agents:
- The first one should use a patrolling movement using waypoints and the ghost smoothing technique. The initial point and direction should be randomly selected.
- The second one should move using a wandering movement.
- The scene should contain some static obstacles ("not walkables").

### Flocking - [Video](https://github.com/xGauss05/ArtificialIntelligence-Exercises/blob/main/Assets/Project/Videos/Flocking.mp4)
Create a scene that simulates a flock of bees (or similar) around its hive.
- Add some random behavior to the movement.
- Optional: add a follow the leader component.

### Perception - [Video](https://github.com/xGauss05/ArtificialIntelligence-Exercises/blob/main/Assets/Project/Videos/Perception.mp4)
Replicate the Zombies Scene in slide 10 of "World Interfacing & Knowledge" topic, following next constraints:

- Implement the zombies with an unique prefab.
- Use camera frustum for zombies perception.
- Use Unity Messaging's BroadcastMessage method for communication between zombies.

### Finite State Machine - [Video](https://github.com/xGauss05/ArtificialIntelligence-Exercises/blob/main/Assets/Project/Videos/FiniteStateMachine.mp4)

- Option 1: use delegates 
- Option 2: use the Unity's animation

### Behavior Bricks -[Video]()
Reproduce the robber behaviour in video of slide 9 of "Decision Making" with Behavior Bricks asset (Behaviour Trees implementation).
