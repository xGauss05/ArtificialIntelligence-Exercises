## Exercises
### Patrolling & Wander
Create an scene with two agents:

- The first one should use a patrolling movement using waypoints and the ghost smoothing technique. The initial point and direction should be randomly selected.
- The second one should move using a wandering movement.
- The scene should contain some static obstacles ("not walkables").
